# pydrmaa2
Python DRMAA2 interface using SWIG.

NOTE: this package is pre-alpha.

This generates a Python interface to DRMAA2 using SWIG. Requires an existing 
DRMAA2 library and include file, e.g. from Univa Grid Engine.

Built with:
* SWIG 3.0.7
* Univa Grid Engine 8.2.0
* Python 3.5.0 (though it should work with Python 2.7)
